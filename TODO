Make it compile with ghc-7.0 (also 6.12?)

Libraries

- geometry

- graphs
  - graph property record to configure the graph

- charts

- text
  - formulas (fractions, sub/superscript etc)
  - text on curve (actually can be a general combinator)
  - svg
    - kerning
      - handle char ranges in kern tags
    - documentation
  - parse ttf?
    - use MacOS api functions to do it?
    - might be more work than it's worth, the Liberation open source
      fonts can be converted to svg

- fractals, procedural generation stuff
  - trees?
  - make use of bindCurve (or similar) to make it easier to do things like
    the fractal

tidier examples

3D
  - shading would require parameterized fill colour

Look at the diagrams package for inspiration
  - backend for the diagrams package?

Advanced font rendering techniques
  - hinting: tweak shapes to make integral pixel coords fall inside
    (a narrow rectangle will be shifted to contain pixel coords)
  - subpixel rendering (take advantage of RGB display layout)
  - not sure how to do hinting, but subpixel rendering might be possible

BUGS

autoFit behaves strangely if entire image is frozen
